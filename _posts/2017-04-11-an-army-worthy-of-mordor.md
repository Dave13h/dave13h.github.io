Is it too cliche to have a flat plane with a scrolling texture on it for fluids? Maybe.. maybe, but you have to start somewhere.

<div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3reEYz05imI" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" style="position:absolute;width:100%;height:100%;left:0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
